## [題目敘述](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-29)

Given the binary representation of an integer as a string `s`, return *the number of steps to reduce it to `1` under the following rules*:

- If the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`.
- If the current number is odd, you have to add `1` to it.

It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.

### Example 1

> **Input:** s = "1101"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14.
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.
Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2.
Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.

### Example 2

> **Input:** s = "10"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** "10" corressponds to number 2 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1. 

### Example 3

> **Input:** s = "1"
**Output:** 0

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSteps(String s) {
        int steps = 0;
        int carry = 0;
        
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            int num = s.charAt(i) - '0' + carry;
            carry = 1;
            
            if(num == 0)  carry = 0;
            else if(num == 1) steps++;

            steps++;
        }
        
        return (carry == 1) ? steps + 1 : steps;
    }
}
